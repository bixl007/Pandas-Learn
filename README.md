# Pandas-Learn

This Repo contains all the code that I wrote while learning Pandas.

## Getting Started

To get started with this Repo, you can clone the repository and install any necessary dependencies.

```bash
# It's recommended to use a virtual environment
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `myenv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies (if any)
# pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

## Running the code

To run the scripts:

```bash
python filename.py
```
